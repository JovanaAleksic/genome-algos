# Genomics Data Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms developed for analyzing and processing genomics data at Weill Cornell Medicine Qatar. Specifically for the AVA-seq method, which is a novel approach for mapping protein-protein interactions. The method is detailed in the following publications: 

[Novel protein contact points among TP53 and minichromosome maintenance complex proteins 2, 3, and 5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cam4.4805)

[Identifying novel interactions of the colon-cancer related APC protein with Wnt-pathway nuclear transcription factors](https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02799-1)

[Scaling-up a fragment-based proteinâ€“protein interaction method using a human reference interaction set](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.26288)
